// What is a tree
//////////////////////////////

Applications:
- Organization charts
- File systems
- Programming Environments

Every Node except a root node has a unique parent

Empty structure is an empty tree

Non-empty tree consists of a root and its children, where these children are also trees

//////////////////////////////
// Tree Terminology
//////////////////////////////

Root: unique node without a parent
Parent
Child
Siblings: 
    children of the same parents
Descendants: 
    a set of node under that node are Descendants 
    child, granchild, great-grandchild, etc.
Ancestors: 
    From any node, the path contains a node to the root node are ancestors
    parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, etc.
Degree: 
    number of children of that node
    Degree = 0: leaf nodes, external node
    Degree > 0: non-leaf nodes, internal nodes, 
Degree of a tree
    The maximum degree of a node in the tree
Internal: 
    node with at least 1 child (is also including root)
    non-terminal node
External
    node without children
    leaf
Level of a node (depth) 
    By default it is 1 (other documents said 0): level of the root
    If a father has level i then its children has level i + 1
Height of a tree
    Maximum level in a tree
    A single node is a tree of height 1
    Empty tree has the height of 0
Height of a node p
    Is the height of the sub-tree with root p
Forest
    A collection of trees

Path
    from a root through a unique sequences of edges (arcs)
    Number of arces in a pth is called the length of the path

// Ordered Tree
//////////////////////////////

An ordered tree
- a meaningful linear order among the children of each node

// Binary Tree
//////////////////////////////

An empty tree is an binary tree

Unlabelled Node & Label Node
    Given number of nodes, how many shape of binary tree can be maked based on UN and LN
        UN: Catalon Number = (2nCn) / (n+1)
        LN: ((2nCn) / (n+1)) * n!
    ((2nCn) / (n+1)): number of shapes
    n! : fillings, or permutation

A proper binary tree
    full binary tree or 2-tree
    every node other than the leaves has 2 children

A complete binary tree
    all non-terminal nodes have both their children
    all leaves are at the same level

Binary Tree Traversals
    Breadth-first traversal:
    Depth-first traversal
        Pre-order: Node - L - R
        In-order: 

//////////////////////////////
// The tree abstract data type
//////////////////////////////

A tree ADT
- using the concept of a position as an abstraction for a node of a tree
- position satisfy parent-child relationships

// Binary Search Tree

What is that
    - Is an orderly binary tree whose nodes's value are ordered from left to right

Natural Orders
    - On numbers: numerical comparison
    - On characters, strings: Dictionary order -> ASCII comparison


int reserve = 0;

If node.left != null reserv++
else if node.right != null resetve++;

return reserve;
