// What is a tree
//////////////////////////////

Applications:
- Organization charts
- File systems
- Programming Environments

Every Node except a root node has a unique parent

Empty structure is an empty tree

Non-empty tree consists of a root and its children, where these children are also trees

//////////////////////////////
// Tree Terminology
//////////////////////////////

Root: unique node without a parent
Parent
Child
Siblings: 
    children of the same parents
Descendants: 
    a set of node under that node are Descendants 
    child, granchild, great-grandchild, etc.
Ancestors: 
    From any node, the path contains a node to the root node are ancestors
    parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, etc.
Degree: 
    number of children of that node
    Degree = 0: leaf nodes, external node
    Degree > 0: non-leaf nodes, internal nodes, 
Degree of a tree
    The maximum degree of a node in the tree
Internal: 
    node with at least 1 child (is also including root)
    non-terminal node
External
    node without children
    leaf
Level of a node (depth) 
    By default it is 1 (other documents said 0): level of the root
    If a father has level i then its children has level i + 1
Height of a tree
    Maximum level in a tree
    A single node is a tree of height 1
    Empty tree has the height of 0
Height of a node p
    Is the height of the sub-tree with root p
Forest
    A collection of trees

Path
    from a root through a unique sequences of edges (arcs)
    Number of arces in a pth is called the length of the path

// Ordered Tree
//////////////////////////////

An ordered tree
- a meaningful linear order among the children of each node

//////////////////////////////
// Binary Tree (Full, Complete, 
                Perfect, Balanced, Height-balanced
                Decision, Threaded, Ordered, AVL)
//////////////////////////////

Full Binary Tree
    a node can only has 0 or 2 children

Complete Binary Tree
    When filling out all node at each level from to - bottom, left - right
    Except the last level, but it has to be on the left

    leaves = non-terminals + 1

Height-balanced
    For every internal node p of T, the heighest of the children of p differ by at most 1

Perfect Binary Tree
    Complete + full
    A non-terminal node only have 2 children
    All leaves are at the same level, all path from root to leaves are at the same
    
    Min height = logbase2 of (n+1)

Decision Tree
    a binary tree in which all nodes have either 0 or 2 nonempty children

Threaded Tree
    is a tree in which node's references are used to point to nodes' predecessor
    or successor. Stack is not needed in Depth-first traversals

Ordered Tree

//////////////////////////////
// Binary Tree
//////////////////////////////

An empty tree is an binary tree

Unlabelled Node & Label Node
    Given number of nodes, how many shape of binary tree can be maked based on UN and LN
        UN: Catalon Number = (2nCn) / (n+1)
        LN: ((2nCn) / (n+1)) * n!
    ((2nCn) / (n+1)): number of shapes
    n! : fillings, or permutation

A proper binary tree
    full binary tree or 2-tree
    every node other than the leaves has 2 children

A perfect binary tree
    
A complete binary tree
    all non-terminal nodes have both their children
    all leaves are at the same level
    
    leaves = non-ternimals + 1

A decision tree
    all nodes have either 0 or two non empty children
    yes - no
        root: start the decision process
        non-terminal node is a test
        a leaf is a specific final decision

Binary Tree Traversals
    Breadth-first traversal:
    Depth-first traversal
        Pre-order: Node - L - R
        In-order: 

//////////////////////////////
// The tree abstract data type
//////////////////////////////

Approach 1: Using 1D array
    case 1: there are rules to specifiy father-child relations
        left child index = 2 * father index + 1
        right child inde = 2 * father index + 2
        father index = floor(child index/2)

    case 2: there is no rule to specify father-child relations
        root element at position 0
        child indices must be stored in 3 arrays (info, left, right)
            If dont have child, then the value at left or right
            array will be -1

Approach 2: Using a linked data structure
    
//////////////////////////////
// Binary Search Tree
//////////////////////////////

What is that
    - Is an orderly binary tree whose nodes's value are ordered from left to right

Natural Orders
    - On numbers: numerical comparison
    - On characters, strings: Dictionary order -> ASCII comparison

///////////////////////////////////
// Balancing the Binary Search Tree 
///////////////////////////////////

What is the Balanced Binary Tree
- If the difference in heigh of both sub-tree of any node in the  reee is either 0 or 1


Case 1: The BST is empty, input is an array
    Order of values in the array which will be added must be considered appropriately

    - Rebuild the BST from stratch based on array
        (Step 1: Copy all tree nodes to the array) - O(n), space is O(n)

        (Step 2: sort the array) -> O(nlogn) or O(n^2)

        (Step 3: clear the tree) -> System-level cost

        (Step 4: call balance() method to rebuild the tree) - O(n^2) or O(nlogn)

Case 2: The BST is given, but it's not balanced
    A balancing algorithm must be implemented

    - The DSW algorithm (Day-Stout-Warren algorithm)
        (Step 1: Create a backbone using right rotation 
                to transform a BST to transform a BST 
                to right-degraded BST) -> O(n)

        (Step 2: Create balanced tree using left rotations to
                transform it to balanced BST) -> O(n)
    
//////////////////////////////
// Self-Balanced BSTs
// (AVL trees)
//////////////////////////////

AVL trees
    When inserting or removing may cause the tree un-balanced State of some nodes may change)
    In this case, the tree needs re-balance using rotations


Calculate the balance factor

Rotation
    Single rotation
        - Left rotation
        - Right rotation
    Double rotation
        - Left-right rotation
        - Right-left rotation

//////////////////////////////
// Binary Heap (Max & Min)
//////////////////////////////

What is the heap
    A collection whose items are layered
    A complete binary tree
    A special binary tree, based on comparison values on father node and child node
        Max Heap
        Min Heap

Heap in memory
    An array-based binary tree
    Item in the index 0 is the tree's root
    Values are put to the tree based on layer in left-to-right direction
    We can have multiple heap
        As long as root -> children and nodes are layered from left to right

Father index, Child index
    Father Idx = floor(child Idx / 2)
    Child Idx (left) = father * 2 + 1
    Child Idx (right) = father * 2 + 2

How to construct the max heap
    

Applications
    A heap can be used as priority queue
    Heap sort
